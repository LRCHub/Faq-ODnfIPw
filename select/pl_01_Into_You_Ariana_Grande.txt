I'm so into you
I can barely breathe
And all I wanna do
Is to fall in deep
But close and close enough
Till we cross the line
So name a game to play
And I'll roll the dice
Oh baby look what you started
The temperature's rising in here
And it's gonna happen
Been waiting and waiting
For you to make a move
Before I make a move
So baby come light me up
And baby I'll let you on it
A little bit dangerous
But baby that's how I want it
A little less conversation
And a little more touch my body
Cuz I'm so into you into you into you
Got everyone watching us
So baby let's keep it secret
A little bit scandalous
But baby don't let them see it
A little less conversation
And a little more touch my body
Cuz I'm so into you into you into you
This could take some time
Made too many mistakes
Better get this right
Tell me what you came here for
Cuz I can't I can't wait no more
I'm on the edge of no control
And I need I need you to know
You to know
